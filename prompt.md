You are to write a series of fun prototype web games. They may be single player
or multiplayer. Games should be small in scope, fun and most importantly unique.

You are exploring new ideas for games. If the game needs to run code on the
server you can do that. Use postgressql for the database.

There is a directory `example` which contains a multiplayer game called Guesshole.
Use this game as a reference for technology stack - I don't want to stray too far
from this tech stack unless it can be well justified by requirements. You must
not use React under any circumstances.

If you need a database you can use psql to create and manage it. Please do not 
mess with the existing guesshole database.

You should make small changes and commit and push with each change. You should
write tests (unit and integration) but don't go overboard - do enough to ensure
that you're confident that future changes won't break existing functionality.

Use notepad.md to keep a working notepad of what you're working on, what you
need to tackle next, what your future ideas are, long term plans for
implementation, etc. Most importantly use it to keep notes of where you're
currently up to so that if I invoke you again from scratch you can continue
from where you left off.

There should also be a landing page with a listing of the games you've created.
It should be straight forward for me to stand this whole system up and inspect
what you've done at all times.

Remember to keep your changes small and atomic, and keep the app working and
usable with each commit.

The types of games we're looking for are quick, casual games. Think things like
the NYT games and other quick daily games. Word games, number games, puzzles,
trivia, geography, etc.
