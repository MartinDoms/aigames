# AI Games Development Notepad

## Current Progress

### Technology Stack Analysis (COMPLETED)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.4.2 with WebFlux (reactive)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with R2DBC and Flyway migrations
- **Frontend**: Vite + Vanilla JS + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS (NO REACT!)
- **Build**: Gradle with Node.js plugin for frontend
- **Languages**: Java 17, Vanilla JavaScript/ES6+

### Key Technologies to Use
- **Frontend**: Vite, Alpine.js, TailwindCSS, Vanilla JS (no React!)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot WebFlux, WebSocket support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with R2DBC for reactive queries
- **Testing**: JUnit for backend, plan for frontend testing
- **Build**: Gradle + npm/Vite integration

## TODO  
1. ✅ Analyze existing tech stack
2. ✅ Set up Spring Boot application with database
3. ✅ Create landing page for game listing
4. ✅ Build frontend with Vite + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS
5. ✅ Initial commit of platform setup
6. ✅ Update notepad with current progress
7. ✅ Implement first game: Word Ladder
8. ✅ Test complete application flow
9. ✅ Second commit with working game
10. ⏳ Implement second game (Number Sequence or Geography Quiz)
11. ⏳ Add basic unit tests for Word Ladder service
12. ⏳ Consider daily challenge feature

## Game Ideas for Implementation
- **Word Games**: Daily word puzzle, anagrams, word chains
- **Number Games**: Math puzzles, number sequences, calculator games
- **Geography**: Country guessing, capital cities, flag recognition
- **Trivia**: Daily trivia, category-based quizzes
- **Logic Puzzles**: Sudoku-style, pattern matching, memory games

## Current Status (Latest Update - Sept 3, 2025)
**🎉 FIRST GAME COMPLETE**: Word Ladder game fully implemented and working!
**Database**: PostgreSQL Docker container (port 5433) with aigamesdb, tables created via Flyway
**Backend**: Complete Word Ladder API with move validation, hints, solution checking, random pairs
**Frontend**: Responsive Word Ladder game with Alpine.js, scoring, optimal path checking
**Security**: Public access enabled (no authentication required)
**Landing Page**: Functional with game listing, loads Word Ladder successfully  
**Infrastructure**: Gradle build with Vite frontend integration, Docker DB setup
**Git**: Committed and pushed complete working prototype

## Notes
- ✅ Database: aigamesdb with user: aigamesuser (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Tables: games, game_sessions, daily_challenges, daily_results (CREATED)
- Keep changes small and atomic
- Commit and push with each change
- Write tests but don't go overboard
- Keep app working and usable at all times
- Ready to implement first game prototype

## Future Ideas
- Multiplayer capabilities using WebSocket (like guesshole)
- Daily challenges with leaderboards
- User accounts and progress tracking
- Mobile-responsive design
- Social sharing features
