## TODO  
1. ✅ Analyze existing tech stack
2. ✅ Set up Spring Boot application with database
3. ✅ Create landing page for game listing
4. ✅ Build frontend with Vite + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS
5. ✅ Initial commit of platform setup
6. ✅ Update notepad with current progress
7. ✅ Implement first game: Word Ladder
8. ✅ Test complete application flow
9. ✅ Second commit with working game
10. ✅ Implement second game: Number Sequence with 8 sequence types
11. ✅ Implement third game: Geography Quiz with multiple question types
12. ⏳ Add basic unit tests for all three games
13. ⏳ Consider daily challenge feature
14. ⏳ Add game statistics tracking to database

## Game Ideas for Implementation
- **Word Games**: Daily word puzzle, anagrams, word chains

## Notes
- ✅ Database: aigamesdb with user: aigamesuser (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Tables: games, game_sessions, daily_challenges, daily_results (CREATED)
- Keep changes small and atomic
- Commit and push with each change
- Write tests but don't go overboard
- Keep app working and usable at all times
- Ready to implement first game prototype

## Future Ideas
- Multiplayer capabilities using WebSocket (like guesshole)
- Daily challenges with leaderboards
